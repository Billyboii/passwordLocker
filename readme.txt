To run the program, type in terminal "python Program.py". all other files run in the background.

client.py will be the user interaction with the program.

server.py will be the server logic of handling client data such as passwords and accounts.

CreateAccount.py will handle creating user accounts and storing them in a text file.

Login.py will read from text file to verify user account and password.

Don't worry about file "no_bytecode".
